# ShopManagementSystemCS161

(Program is in the build folder)

The system has 3 main functions: List, Restock and Sell
- The list displays the ID, name, price and available copies for an item
- Restock either adds copies to an existing item or adds a new item to stock
- Sell calculates the price of the entire bill and deducts copies from stock

After exiting, the program saves the newly displayed data into a savefile, which will be reused for future uses
